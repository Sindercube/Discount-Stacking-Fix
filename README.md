# About

**Discount Stacking Fix** is a **server-side** mod which **removes** villager curing discounts from the game.

It (technically) fixes [MC-181190](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-181190), a **bug**, not a feature.

While not very realistic (villagers SHOULD reward you for curing them... at least if you didn't let them get zombified, but you wouldn't do that to them, you aren't cruel), it balances the game.

Not only is this "feature" **absolutely busted**, it is also **completely unfit for a "survival" game**, because it simplifies your "survival" down to **torturing farmhands** and **entombing them inside of a 1x2x1 hole**.

Don't worry though, if you prefer villagers **being unbalanced**, you can simply **not use this mod**. Such is the magic of modding.

# Usage

The mod should work on all versions of the game starting from **Minecraft 1.14**.

You do not need to have this mod installed on your client in order to connect to a server which has it.

You can feel freely use this mod in your modpacks.

# To-Do

- Discounts should be limited to only one per villager.
Unfortunately, due to my lack of java knowledge, or possibly due to how poorly the villager interaction code is made, i am unable to do this.
