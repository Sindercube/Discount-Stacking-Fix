# About

**Discount Stacking Fix** is a **server-side** mod which simply ~~changes villagers to only ever be able to lower their prices once if cured~~ **removes** villager curing discounts from the game.

It (technically) fixes [MC-181190](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-181190), a **bug**, not a feature.

Not only is this "feature" **absolutely busted**, it is also **completely unfit for a "survival" game**, because it simplifies your "survival" down to **torturing farmhands** and **entombing them inside of a 1x2x1 hole**.

Don't worry though, if you prefer villagers **being unbalanced**, you can simply **not use this mod**. Such is the magic of modding.

###### </passive></aggressive>

# Usage

The mod should work on all versions of the game starting from **Minecraft 1.14**.

You do not need to have this mod installed on your client in order to connect to a server which has it.

You can feel freely use this mod in your modpacks.

# To-Do

- Discounts should be limited to only one per villager.
Unfortunately, due to my lack of java knowledge, or possibly due to how poorly the villager interaction code is made, i am unable to do this.
